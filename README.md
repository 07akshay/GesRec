# Gesture-Recognition-Using-OpenCV

In this project, I am using a Resnet18 to recognize the character on the blackscreen. OpenCV has been used to track the movement of a circular blue object on the screen, whose coordinates are later merged to construct the character on the blackscreen.
Resnet18 model that I have used is self defined(use the pretrained model from KERAS for better results).
